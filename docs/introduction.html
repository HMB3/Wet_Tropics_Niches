<p>The aim of this thesis is to test empirical relationships between gross primary productivity and plant ecological specialisation across broad spatial, temporal and biological scales. Two measures of ecological specialisation are used: the change in the identity of plant species between locations, and the aggregated environmental distributions of all plant species occurring at a location. Additionally, this thesis examines how individual environmental distributions of Australia’s tropical flora — their realised environmental niches — vary across continental environmental gradients, as a proxy of how specialised each plant species has become to local conditions.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The concept of ‘scale’ is central to all ecological and biogeographical theories, and has several components — notably the extent and resolution of analysis. And so it is necessary to define at the outset how scale is used in this thesis. I use the terms broad-scale and macroecological to refer to ecological analyses using data for the largest possible suite of taxa (for example the Australian flora, thus constituting a broad biological extent), across the broadest possible geographic extents (for example continental Australia). This is distinct from the resolution component of scale, for which I also use the term fine-scale to denote the finest possible spatial resolution (for example grid cells of 1 km × 1 km).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Before defining ecological specialisation, the broader concept of biological diversity warrants consideration, given the intrinsic historical and thematic links between all concepts of biological rarity and specialisation. Initially, it is important to emphasise that the study of the multitude of organisms with which we share the planet has a long history, across all cultures. From a formal scientific perspective, the rest of life on earth came to be known as biological diversity or biodiversity in the latter part of the 20th century (Faith, 2008), a term most directly attributed to the American biologists E.O. Wilson (Wilson, 1988) and Tomas Lovejoy (Lovejoy, 1980). The deceptively simple fact that there is such a variety of different kinds of organisms on earth today, and that their individual and collective distributions vary with such complexity across space and time, poses a fundamental, if not rhetorical, question: what factors drive diversity? The classic ecological definition of biodiversity was devised by the American ecologist Robert Whittaker (1960), and attempts to capture the variety of life by partitioning diversity into three components:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>1).</strong> α-diversity: the count, or richness, of biological types at a particular location. For example the total number of species, genera or families recorded at an ecological survey plot of &lt;1ha in a tropical rainforest.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>2).</strong> β-diversity: the change in biological identity, or turnover, between two or more locations within a broader region. For example the turnover of plant genera between a pair of ecological survey plots in a tract of tropical rainforest, ranging from 0 (no biological turnover, all taxa shared) to 1 (complete turnover, no taxa shared). β-diversity can thus be used to approximate the degree of biological heterogeneity within a region.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>3).</strong> γ-diversity: the total number of biological types in a region. For example the total number of plant genera known to occur in a tract of tropical rainforest derived from the aggregate of many ecological survey plots.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>These definitions are not absolute. Indeed they are challenged by fundamental questions about the often unexamined philosophical underpinnings of taxonomic classification itself. Despite the inherent limitations of such definitions, and regardless of the particular definition of biodiversity adopted, the core concept uniting them is that of biological variety (IUCN, 1980). This viewpoint is neatly captured by Faith (2016), who described biodiversity as the “living variation” at multiple levels of biological organisation, counted for a set of objects (for example the turnover in species, phenotypes and genotypes between forest plots). This clarifies ‘variability’ as meaning ‘variety’ with regard to the definition of biodiversity adopted by countries around the world as signatories to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD):</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><em>“Biological diversity means the variability among living organisms from all sources including, inter alia, terrestrial, marine and other aquatic ecosystems and the ecological complexes of which they are part; this includes diversity within species, between species and of ecosystems.”</em>
(Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity, 2005), p. 4.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Within this framework, the concept of linking biological identity to place is at the core of defining biodiversity, as well as underpinning all attempts to explain the variety of life and processes that drive evolution, such as the dynamics of environmental conditions. The last 30 years have seen a subtle yet important shift of research focus in the ecological branch of the life sciences, from one of explaining the causes of biodiversity, to examining consequences. This change in focus has been motivated by another fundamental question: does diversity matter? The search for the consequences of biodiversity goes back to at least the writings of Charles Darwin, and probably much earlier. In Chapter IV of The Origin of Species (which outlines the mechanics of Natural Selection), Darwin discusses the relationship between photosynthetic activity and plant diversity, as yet another illustration of the principle of character divergence:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><em>“The more diversified the descendants from any one species become in structure, constitution and habits, by so much will they be better enabled to seize on many and widely diversified places in the polity of nature.It has been experimentally proved, that if a plot of ground be sown with one species of grass, and a similar plot be sown with several distinct genera of grasses, a greater number of plants and a greater weight of dry herbage can thus be raised.”</em> (Darwin, 1859) p. 93.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Darwin was speaking here of the taxonomic α-diversity of each respective plot — and by his use of genera, he was also invoking the phylogenetic relationships between the plants (before the genetic basis of natural selection had been revealed, of course). As Darwin hints, the ecological concept that locations in anthropogenic or natural landscapes with greater plant diversity should display greater photosynthetic capacity is longstanding, presumably from many generations of horticultural experimentation. In contemporary ecology, this concept has come to be known as the principle of biological complementarity (Grime, 1998). The core idea is that greater biological richness at a location (i.e. α-diversity) reflects a greater variety of resource acquisition strategies, which in turn should facilitate higher plant photosynthetic activity, and ultimately greater biomass production. By invoking the ecological niche, complementarity harks back to the principle of character divergence as discussed by Darwin, with important consequences for studying fluctuations in plant ecological processes across broad scales.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>One of the most important plant ecological processes on earth is primary productivity — the rate at which plants assimilate carbon from the atmosphere through photosynthesis. This thesis focuses solely on gross primary productivity, or GPP, which can be defined as the spatio-temporal photosynthetic flux of carbon between the vegetation and the atmosphere (Donohue et al., 2014). GPP is thus a biophysical parameter, summarising the photosynthetic activity of a suite of plants at a particular location. It will be shaped not only by the collective attributes of plants at each location, but potentially by plants in the surrounding region, depending on the spatial, temporal and biological scales under investigation.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) is but one of many ecosystem functions, a broader ecological concept defined by Ghilarov (2000) as “Stocks or fluxes of matter and energy derived from biological activity”. In this framework, the “dry herbage” referred to by Darwin is the stock (i.e. the biomass), and GPP is the flux. The ecosystem function concept is more ambiguous and value laden than variables such as GPP and rainfall, because the use of the word ‘function’ implies utility, attaching a somewhat anthropogenic connotation to plant-mediated processes (for example carbon, water and nutrient cycles, or fire regimes). The key to the ecosystem function concept is that it switches biological diversity from the response to the explanatory axis, as a predictor variable used to explain ecosystem functions such as productivity. In reality, measures of productivity, environmental conditions and biological diversity are interrelated at multiple spatio-temporal scales. These interrelationships are illustrated by the fact that different measures of biological diversity and primary productivity have been used as both response and explanatory variables over several decades of research, often amid considerable controversy [e.g. Grime (1973); Mittelbach et al. (2001); Lavers and Field (2006); Grace et al. (2014)].</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The impetus to switch measures of biological diversity from the response to the explanatory axis was born of conservation movements in Europe and North America in the latter part of the 20th century. The conservation logic behind this transposition of axes is relatively straightforward. In order to preserve the ecosystem functions at a location — for example primary productivity — it is argued that the entire suite of biological taxa occurring there must be preserved (the α-diversity), not simply the dominant species that may drive productivity (for example large trees in a tropical rainforest). The supposedly causal relationship between ecosystem functions (response variables) and biodiversity (predictor variables, referred to throughout this thesis as B-EF research) has been most directly attributed to the work of the American ecologist David Tilman and his colleagues, beginning with a series of field experiments at Cedar Creek in Minnesota (Tilman, 1982). The original B-EF research dates back to at least the early 1980s, although the first peer-reviewed publications in prominent scientific journals appeared later [e.g. Tilman and Downing (1994)]. The B-EF concept has proliferated in the literature in the years since [e.g. see Cardinale et al. (2012) for a recent review], with thousands of publications on this general topic since 1990.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The typical B-EF experiments test the complementarity mechanism by establishing small plots, approximately 1m2 in size, which are subject to the same environmental conditions. A range of biodiversity treatments are then applied, and the ecosystem function response of each plot is measured over several years (the longest running experiment being Cedar Creek, for approximately 30 years). This format is much the same as that alluded to by Darwin. For example previous experiments have varied the number of species (Gross et al., 2014) and their genetic diversity (Cadotte, 2013). The utilitarian argument for conserving biodiversity arising from these experiments — that destroying diversity imperils ecosystem functions on which humanity depends (Faith et al., 2010) — gathered pace with E.O. Wilson’s popularization of the term biodiversity (Wilson, 1988). Similarly, the momentum to support conservation initiatives generated by the Rio Earth Summit and the Kyoto Protocol, as well as attempts to quantify the increased rates of extinction driven by human activity [e.g. Vitousek et al. (1997); Ceballos et al. (2015)], have added political weight to the overarching B-EF argument. Despite a substantial volume of literature demonstrating experimental links between different measures of ecosystem functions and biological diversity [e.g. Hooper et al. (2005); Cardinale et al. (2012)], the B-EF concept faces a pivotal test: can the relationships from plot-scale, artificial experiments be generalised to broader continental scales relevant for conservation initiatives?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The empirical evidence for B-EF relationships has thus far proven equivocal, particularly across broad spatio-temporal scales. For example Chisholm et al. (2013) found that relationships between the productivity of forest plots and α-diversity can in fact be negative at spatial resolutions that are coarser than typical B-EF experiments (for example 1 hectare). Some authors have dismissed bivariate analyses of productivity and diversity as incapable of capturing the network of interactions needed to accurately characterise the ecological dynamics in complex systems [e.g. Grace et al. (2014); Grace et al. (2016)]. Similarly, it was recently argued that broad-scale analyses of B-EF relationships — such as regional or continental studies using observational biological data and interpolated environmental data — cannot sufficiently characterise the underlying mechanisms (Pasari et al., 2013). These are worthy criticisms, given the innate complexity of multi-scale ecological interactions. Nevertheless, if the complementarity principle is generally applicable in nature, then it should hold across scales. Furthermore, broad-scale ecological analyses must necessarily quantify variables at much coarser spatial resolutions than manipulated experiments (for example 1km2 vs 1m2), which may alter the observed statistical relationships (Openshaw, 1983). This is a somewhat mundane but important point, not only for this thesis, but for any broad-scale empirical analyses of the B-EF concept.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It was recently proposed that ecologists should shift their focus from the α-dimension of biodiversity (biological richness) to the β-dimension (biological turnover), in order to find broad-scale, cause and effect links between ecosystem functions and biodiversity in natural environments (Pasari et al., 2013). This idea has intuitive appeal. It seems plausible that the spatial and temporal turnover of plants between locations within a region, and hence the turnover in their characteristics, would affect the magnitude and variability of ecosystem functions such as primary productivity, both at individual locations and across entire regions. This is because floristic turnover — in geographic and environmental space, and also through time — indirectly approximates spatio-temporal changes in the biophysical characteristics of the flora, which could influence spatio-temporal fluctuations in the photosynthetic flux of carbon (Figure 1.1).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/HMB3/Beta-Diversity-vs-Productivity/blob/master/docs/fig_1.1.png?raw=true" /></p>
<p><strong>Figure 1.1</strong> Classic plot-scale B-EF experiments (a) suggest that ecosystem functions (e.g. productivity, biomass production and nutrient cycling) increase monotonically with biological richness [i.e. α-diversity, see Cardinale et al. (2012)]. These controlled experiments remove the biological interactions between locations that would occur in natural environments by fencing off plots [b, reproduced from Mokany et al. (2013b)], thus negating the potential effect of biological turnover on ecosystem functions (Regional EF). Compositional differences between interacting communities (c) enable new species with different physiological responses (e.g. fire response functional traits such as seeding or sprouting in the Australian context) to disperse between communities as environmental conditions change. This temporal turnover in community composition is likely to be strongly influenced by the initial spatial β-diversity of the metacommunity in which each community resides. Thus empirical analyses across broad spatio-temporal and biological scales could account for the important within (blue arrows) and between (red arrows) biological turnover between communities, which may influence ecosystem functions (EF) at both local and regional scales.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The concept of ecological specialisation provides the theoretical link between ecosystem functions and biological turnover. Regions exhibiting high biological turnover between locations, for example tropical rainforests, are characterised by greater biological heterogeneity than regions exhibiting low biological turnover, such as boreal forests. This heterogeneity means that many plants occur in narrow portions of geographic and environmental space. Indeed some plants may be known to occur only in small parts of a particular region, making them endemic to that region. Endemic taxa can become highly specialised — physiologically, and thus ecologically — to current environmental conditions though adaptive evolutionary processes. Consequently, these narrowly distributed taxa may perform processes such as photosynthesis more optimally at the centre of their environmental distribution than taxa which are distributed across the whole landscape. Put another way, if every kind of plant occurred everywhere across a tropical rainforest, there would be no biological turnover in environmental space. All locations within the forest would then be populated by plants with generalised physiological attributes, and the landscape would be rendered biologically homogenous. Throughout this thesis I am asking the general question: would we expect the productivity at each location within a landscape to be higher or lower if the landscape was biologically heterogeneous, rather than homogenous?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>In the conceptual framework outlined above, it is the degree of ecological specialisation — both at individual locations, and across regions — that can directly affect ecosystem functions, rather than the biological turnover itself (which is simply an indirect proxy of specialisation and the biogeographic processes that have formed it). For this research, I define the ecological specialisation of an individual plant species as its realised environmental niche (Austin et al., 1990) — for example the range of rainfall and temperature conditions across all geographic locations where a tropical tree species has been recorded. I further define ecological specialisation with regard to an individual location, or site, as the median of the realised environmental niches for all species present at that site. Hence the crucial information for calculating measures of ecological specialisation is location data, derived from ecological surveys recording what plants occur where, which can be linked to ecosystem functions and environmental conditions. Recent theoretical, experimental and empirical analyses have demonstrated links between ecosystem functions and measures of biological turnover as proxies of ecological specialisation (Pasari et al., 2013; Wang &amp; Loreau, 2014; Van Der Plas et al., 2016). However, these relationships have not as yet been demonstrated across broad spatial, biological and environmental scales in real ecosystems. Addressing the interrelationships between ecosystem functions, environmental conditions and species’ environmental distributions outlined above, this research tests three components of the relationship between gross primary productivity (GPP) and ecological specialisation:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>1)</strong> Is GPP related to floristic β-diversity in geographic space across continental environmental gradients?</p>
<p><strong>2)</strong> Does the ecological specialisation of individual species vary systematically across continental environmental gradients?</p>
<p><strong>3)</strong> Is the GPP of individual sites related to the ecological specialisation of the species which occur at those sites?</p>
<p><br />

<p>There are two key analytical avenues by which these questions could be tested. Firstly, by empirical means, using measurements for GPP, environmental conditions and ecological specialisation; and secondly, by simulating these variables and their interrelationships. Here I argue that B-EF relationships can only be useful for broad-scale land management — a key justification in the literature — if links between ecosystem functions and biodiversity can be demonstrated in nature. Thus I focus on testing these questions empirically, across the broadest possible spatial, temporal and biological scales. The following Chapter (Chapter 2) outlines a broader problem space than the questions given above: that of empirically testing current and future relationships between ecosystem functions and ecological specialisation. The remainder of this Chapter describes the geographic and biological scope of the thesis, concluding with an outline of the thesis structure.</p>

<p>The analyses in this thesis were conducted using geographic distribution records for vascular plant species which occur within the Australian continent. The geographic species records for Australian plants are among the best in the Atlas of Living Australia (www.ala.org.au), which is the Australian node of the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF, www.gbif.org). Thus Australia represents an ideal case study for testing empirical relationships between primary productivity and ecological specialisation. Nonetheless, it is important to note that some of the taxa that occur within Australia are also distributed more widely across South East Asia and the Pacific. Unfortunately, the spatial density of the geographic species records in other countries is lower than the records from within Australia. Given the importance of accurate ‘what and where’ data to testing the research questions, I have only analysed the environmental distributions of plants within the Australian continent.</p>

<p>The Australian vascular flora constitutes a highly diverse mixture of approximately 20,000 vascular plant species (Orchard, 1999). The flora are derived from two main sources: those considered to have evolved on the Gondwanan land mass (for example plants in the genera Eucalyptus and Banksia), and those thought to have arrived in the last 33 million years (Crayn et al., 2015) via dispersal from South East Asia (for example palms in the genus Livistona). Australia’s Gondwanan ancestry, combined with its geological isolation since separating from Antarctica — and the subsequent evolution of its climate and soils during this period of isolation — have shaped the character of Australian plants and their geographic and environmental distributions (Crisp &amp; Cook, 2013).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>After the Australian landmass separated from Antarctica approximately 38 million years ago, it drifted northward towards the equator, creating a drier, more seasonal climate, compared with the wetter conditions that prevailed in Australia prior to separation (White, 1994; Crayn et al., 2015). With increasing proximity to Asia, monsoonal conditions arose in northern Australia. The prolonged seasonal drying that accompanied the monsoon fostered the adaptive radiation of sclerophyllous, fire-adapted taxa which dominate contemporary plant habitats across large areas of arid and tropical Australia [Crisp et al. (2011); Crisp and Cook (2013); Pfautsch et al. (2016), Figure 1.2 a]. Thus most species which originated on the Australian tectonic plate have adapted to dry, fire-prone conditions over tens of millions of years. However, some species have become geographically restricted to the remaining moister environments in coastal and upland areas created by Australia’s drift into tropical latitudes.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The biogeographic forces that have shaped the Australian flora outlined above are encapsulated within the Wet Tropics region of North Queensland (Figure 1.2 c), which contains a diverse admixture of plants of Gondwanan and Asian origins (Barlow &amp; Hyland, 1988; Metcalfe &amp; Ford, 2009). The Wet Tropics is characterised not only by high taxonomic α- and β-diversity, but also by a high proportion of narrowly distributed endemic species relative to the rest of Australia (Crisp et al., 2001; Laffan &amp; Crisp, 2003; González-Orozco et al., 2011; Crisp &amp; Cook, 2013). Indeed only the Southwest Australian Floristic region has higher endemism than the Wet Tropics (Hopper &amp; Gioia, 2004), with both regions being global biodiversity hotspots (Williams et al., 2011). Because endemic species necessarily occupy narrow portions of geographic and environmental space, a high proportion of Wet Tropics species could be considered ecologically and physiologically specialised — making it an ideal bioregion for analysing the relationship between primary productivity and specialisation.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 1.2</strong> Broad biogeographic patterns across continental Australia form the context for the statistical relationships analysed in this thesis. Australia’s floristic biomes [a, reproduced from Crisp and Cook (2013)], and patterns of species richness in 20 km × 20 km grid cells for the Wet Tropics taxa analysed (b, c). Contemporary continental patterns of mean monthly primary productivity (d, g C m-2 month-1 2001-2012) and mean annual rainfall (e, mm, 2001-2012).</p>

<p>Three broad taxonomic subsets were used to test the research questions. The first question — is GPP related to species turnover in geographic space? — was tested using geographic presence-only records for approximately 12,500 vascular plant species across continental Australia from the Australian National Heritage Assessment Tool database [ANHAT, see Williams et al. (2012)]. The second question — does ecological specialisation vary across continental environmental gradients? — was tested using geographic presence-only records for 4292 vascular plant species known to occur in the Australian Wet Tropics Bioregion. The third question — is GPP related to ecological specialisation? — was tested using 948 tree species known to occur in the Wet Tropics. These taxonomic subsets encompass sufficient biological, geographic and environmental space to allow plausible empirical tests of the research questions.</p>
